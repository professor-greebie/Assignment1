# Effective Feedback for Student Success Assignment

## Learning Outcomes

- Gather and document application requirements as a result of analysis of business requirements.
- Apply software design patterns and Model-View-Controller (MVC) as part of a Web solution.
- Develop Web applications using Spring Framework and a modern Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- Apply database theory in the development of persistent data applications and display Web-based reports from Oracle Database.
- Test the quality of Web applications using integration and unit tests, and metrics.

    title Web Applications Development Course Design First Half
    section Review of fundamental web coding concepts
    Week 1 : First lab assessment introduced
           : Course introduced and assessments described.
           : Lab allows students to practice basic web concepts.
           : Basic Spring project setup is explained, although we do not use it until week 4. We will practice the setup each class until week 5 when Spring itself is introduced.
           : Assignment introduces concept of unit tested code (students can use tests to see if they have met requirements).
    Week 2 : Beginning Java
           : Second assessment described and introduced.
           : Lab allows students to practice basic Java concepts they should have become familiar with in the previous term.
           : Opportunity to finish web assignment and gain feedback.
           : Students again run sample unit tests
    section Design Patterns
    Week 3 : GRASP Design Patterns
           : First assignment feedback - How the unit tests worked for that assignment are discussed in brief.
           : Third Assignment described and introduced.
           : GRASP Patterns work and assignments build on techniques introduced in week 2 assignment.
           : GRASP discusses a number of patterns we would use in database theory (Protected variations etc.)
    Week 4 : Gang of Four Design Patterns
           : Second assignment feedback provided - relationship between GRASP and Gang of Four design patterns and basic Java are considered.
           : Gang of Four Patterns lesson are categorized by GRASP. This is a good opportunity to quiz students on the GRASP pattern each GoF pattern is imitating.
    section Introduction to Spring
    Week 5 : Beginning Spring Patterns Introduction to Unit Testing and Test-driven development
           : MVC is discussed for the first time. It will be applied in the next term.
           : Third assignment feedback - great opportunity to look at how Spring uses common design patterns to support web application development.
           : Having built a basic Spring project for all other assignments, we are now going to use the features of Spring for Web Development. The focus for the next term will be web application development with Spring.
           : Having used unit tests to check our code, students will seek to build their own. It will be highly recommended to build unit tests for assignments from now on to assure quality.
           : First introduction to Dependency Injection as a way to reduce coupling.
    section MIDTERM
    Week 6 : Review for Midterm
           : Fourth assignment feedback, Fifth assignment feedback provided by end of week.
           : Review of design patterns.
           : Practice unit testing of various patterns.
    Week 7 : Midterm Evaluation
    section STUDENT SUCCESS
    Week 8 : Student Success Week

           : Assignment 7 provided
           : Reinforce MVC in development and the advantages of the approach. 
           : Different styles of "View" client and server side.
    Week 11 : Spring Database interaction
           : Assignment 6 feedback
           : Assignment 8 provided
           : Reinforce "Model" approach in Spring.
           : Good opportunity to quiz on how dependency injection allows Spring to make interacting with a database easy.
    Week 12 : Spring Flows
           : Assignment 9 provided - Spring Flows assignment revisits design patterns the fundamentals of web application development, making it good for review, mostly.
           : Assignment 7 feedback
    section Integration testing
    Week 13 : Spring Test and integration testing
           : Assignment 10
           : Assignment 8 feedback
           : Integration testing builds on unit testing explained in week 6 with resources to learn more about it.
           : Most students will have completed their full assignments by this time, remaining may opt for assignment 9 and/or 10 to improve their marks, learn more or practice for the exam.
    section FINAL EXAM
    Week 14 : The lecture section provides feedback on the final two assignments, with a class completion of assignment 9 and/or 10 together for review.The Final Exam happens during the lab session.
